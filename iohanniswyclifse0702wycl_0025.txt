public mind was excited by these sermons of Wycliw and inflamed
with hatred for many decades against the prelates and monks. 'l'hc
effect of these sermons must have been the greater, that they were
taken by many for sermons of Hus, as is evident from the marginal
notes of our Ms. D.

How they acted on the Bohemian people at large is testified
by the murdering of the monks, the destruction of the most renowned
churches and cloisters, which ensued in Bohemia after the days os

2. The transmission in MSS.

The sermons of this volume have been preserved in three MSS„
namely the Codex of Trinity Cossege, Cambridge (Al, the Codex pal.
Vindobonensis 3928 (D), and the Codex pal. Vindobonensis 3931 (E).

These three MSS. have already been described in the introduction
to the first volume.·-’ It need only be mentioned here, that the 60⁰¹
sermon (page 445 to 452) is missing in both MSS. D and E, and two
other sermons which in the fourth part of Ms. A occur as numbers
2 and ιι are inserted in its place.

As sermons 27, 28, 31, 32 and 33 embrace the whole contents
of the treatise De Sex Jugis‚ the Ms. of this treatise also (printed by
Lechler, Appendix II, 591 seqq.) was examined, and from its various
readings some improvements have been incorporated into the text.

3. The date and the edition.

have been given in the introduction to the first volume, and Ι have
nothing to add either to it, or to the principles which have guided
me in editing.

On the other hand Ι feel myself bound to express my heartiest
thanks to the founder of the Society Dr. F. J. Furnivall and to
