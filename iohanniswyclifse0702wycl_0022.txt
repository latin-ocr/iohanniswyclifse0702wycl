Thus in one passage he says: ls the Church were deprived of sacraments
and sacrament-al usages, it would not perish for that, for the Christian
needs only to believe in God and observe His law. To him Christ
the Saviour is l'ope, bishop and priest, and He has power to bestow
salvation without these superfluous symbols,

Often transubstantation is discussed¹ and the passages are fairly
numerous, in which he expresses his convictions about miracles,
adoration of the saints and canonisationS.

Satan, he says, can deceive men much more easily by miracles
of the dead, than by holiness of the living.·2

By these false miracles the Church can easily be deceived3 one
nowhere reads that John the Baptist worked miracles, though by the
testimony of Christ Himself, amongst mortals nobody was greater
than St. John.³ So the miracles at the tomb of St. Thomas may even
have been caused by the devil.4 God did not will that honour should
be paid to the body of Moses, nor to that of the Holy Virgin, nor
of the evangelist St. John3 the Bible establishes nothing at all about
the adoration of saints, and this being the case, men sin, who disobey
so far the commandment of the Church triumphant.⁵ Truly pious
men dislike earthly praise and this is also the reason why the Saints
abhor canonisations, which are often false3 they abhor the feasts,‘⁵
which are multiplied out of worldly motives‚ and deprive of their
favour those who keep them in this spirit.⁷ Neither by pilgrimages‚
nor by noisy adoration of the saints and their relies shall we reach
our goal. The saints must be venerated with wisdom; and this is
done best by giving away the finery of the dead to the poor. But
verily he who tells the people this, is condemned as a heretic.

The magnificent architecture of churches, not to speak of
monasteries, is severely blamed. They do not incite to piety‚ but they
divert from it3 they do not prove humility, but the insupportable
pride of the clergy. Of the mendicant friam, Wyclif says, that in

their haughtiness they build mighty houses and towers like the tower
of Babe1.⁸
