So they delude the world, and try to make it believe that whoever
wears a cowl, must needs be a good clergyman.

Useless for defending God’s cause, and following their carnal
instincts, they only care how to satisfy their ambition, and their greed
for worldly pleasures and enjoymentS.

They either idle about in the palaces of the ruling lords or
scour the villages and provinceS, trying to extort their prey by any
means3 so they collect their stores, and live like worldly lords3 and
in spite of all this they say, that they follow the example of Christ
more than others, ssut by searching ever so carefully, hardly one
mendicant friar will be found, who acts according to Christ's doctrine
and example. They like to accept bishopries because they are lucrative3
not like St. John the Baptist clad in skins, but in soft clothing‚ they
live in kings’ houses and hate to reside in the cloister. They not
only contribute nothing to the peace of their fellow-creatures, but
they stir up quarrel and hatred, because they prosper best by it; and
as the nest of the Roman church is their last refuge, they defend it,
and whoever speaks against it, is reviled as a heretic and despised.

From these last remarks, it is evident that Wyclif entered into
conflict with the mendicant friars not only because they accused him
of heresy for his doctrine of the Lord's supper, but because he con-
sidered them the most flexible instruments of Romish absolutism,
and the principal defenders of all ecclesiastical errors and abuses.¹

Therefore in speaking of the errors of his time, the ecclesiastical
abuses, the sins and pretensions of the clergy, and so on, he treats
it all from the point of view of the contest with the mendicant friars.
And this may be the reason why he, who formerly did not much
esteem the endowed orders and blamed them severely for their faults,
now believes them to be on the whole better than the mendicant
friars. Therefore he discusses at length in one of the following
sermons the question: who is the worse, the monk (member of an
endowed order) or the mendicant friar. 2 Although neither live aster
the christian order³ — it would be easier on the whole to lead back
