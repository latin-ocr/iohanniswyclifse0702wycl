INTRODUCTION.

1. The Contents.

The present part contains the most interesting and important
of all Wyclif’s Latin sermons,

Judging only from the other parts, the great effect which Wyclif's
sermons produced upon both his followers and his antagonists‚ would
be almost inexplicable‚ for they consist almost entirely of expositions
of the sacred text and of philosophical disquisitions‚ and it is only
here and there that Wyclif's contest with the life and doctrine of
the hierarchy of his day comes into prominence.

lt does so however in the present volume. Here the political
and ecclesiastical convictions‚ which vvere the ruling ideas of the last
sour years of Wyclif's life, are very forcibly expressed. Almost every
sermon contains some portion of Wyclif's violent contest with the
monks, of which we also hear from his contemporaries, who describe
the ferment produced by him amongst the English clergy, and to
some extent amongst the nation at large.

More will not be attempted in this Introduction, than very
briefly to indicate the contents of the volume, and to point out
wherein lies its significance.

The first sermon is a clue to the character of the whole

collection.

“To-day all states may rejoice” Wyclif exclaims, “rejoice and
be ashamed withal. The princes may rejoice, for under the government
of one of the greatest princes whom the world has ever seen, the
Saviour is born, and He has commanded men to give the worldly
power its due. He Himself paid for Himself and His followers the

tribute due to the Emperor.”
