XXII INTRODUCTION.

Messrs. F. D. Matthew and R. Buddensieg for the valuable help they
have given me in this work.

Special thanks are due to Mr. mathew, without whose indefati-
gable assistance, which appears only in the side-and foot-notes, but
which was far greater than appears, it would have been impossible
for me to finish the edition of the two first volumes of the sermons
within a single year, during which time 1 had to undergo two severe
illnesses.

Czernowitz, Christmas 1887.

J. Loserth.
