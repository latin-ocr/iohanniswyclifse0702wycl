than an>⁷ rule invented later; that the orders are contrary to the law
of Christ, and are not founded on Holy Scripture3 that their members
indulge in pernicious vices doing harm to the individual and to the
whole country; that they must be destroyed.

That the orders are superfluous, is proved by the Holy Scripture
not mentioning them at all, unless indirectly hythe Saviour's warning
against their snares.¹ The founders of such sects are of the number
of those about whom Christ says: Many will come in my name and
say, “I am Christ'' and mislead you. The foundation of an order
must be only Christ. Far from the believer should be the blasphemy
of despising Christ's doctrine and example, and following fallible
guidance instead.

ssut this the mendicant friars do, by saying that their order is
superior to the common Christian doctrine.2 The Church is burdened
with too many servants; and the most superfluous of all are the
mendicant friarS. These make every effort to destroy the old laws of
the Church. How superfluous they are, can be seen from their fruits.³

Once two apostles wandering through far countries, converted
more people than live in England to such religious zeal as the
whole English people does not posseSS, in spite of its many thousands
of mendicant friars, and there is no doubt that the present sad state is
due to the negligence of the clergy, and above all, of these pseudo-monks.

These sects confound the Church: Their thresholds are outside
the religion of Christ.⁴ Their increase weakens the Christian doctrine,
and makes many apostates. ⁵

Christ himself despised such sectS. They are well aware that
they are not founded on Holy Scripture; and therefore they say:
Many things which Jesus did, are not mentioned in the Scriptum, and
so Christ founded these orders, though their foundation is not
mentioned expressly in the Bible.

But by the same reasoning‚ one might conclude that every order
is condemned, because its condemnation is not mentioned in the
{ible3 nay one, might infer it with somevvhat greater certainty, because
some usages and parts of their rule gainsay the Lord’s law. ssut in
Christ and His Scripture “yea and nay'’ is impossible.
