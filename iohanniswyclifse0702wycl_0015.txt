As the sect of those fri-ars and their ··nlonstrous'' rule is not
founded in Scripture‚¹ so also the vow which the monk must take is
without scriptural foundation. With “apish‘⁷ craftiness some friars
argue, that their sect resided on the mount of Carmel even before
the incarnation of Christ, because Elias found there some imitators.
And by similar hair-splitting, others conclude, that the)⁷ are brothers
