INTRODUCTION. xlx

But God despises such buildings and also the Apostle did not
permit such buildings or other monuments, not sanctioncd by the
Holy Scriptum, to be erectedst The grand pal-aces and houses ol' the
mendicant friars, he compares to dens of robbers. Whilst the monks
build cloisters like castles, the mendicant l'riars make themselves
residences like robber's dens.

As of old, Cain built the first town, not for the protection of
the inhabitants of the country, but to conceal his prey‚ so now do
the friars. They build houses and churches in order to deceive the
people who bring them alms, and to conceal their prey. And l'or this
building of churches they erroneously cite the example of Solomon.2

In one passage it is questioned, whether these buildings of the
monks and clergy are of any good at all to the Church.

“And it appears'', Wyclif says, “from this gospel (Matth. XXIV, 35,
that Christ condemned such buildings both by deed and word. They
are neither virtuous in themselves, nor do they incite to virtue. lf
they do, it must he because their beauty augments devotion, but
what reason is there to believe this? Did not the martyrs pray more
devoutly in the dungeon? Did not John the Baptist reach of loftier
height of contemplation in the desert? Did not Christ, as well as the
fathers of the Old and New Testament pray in the open air? For
when Christ passed the night in praying, he was not shut up in a
temple, nor did the patriarchs need a temple for their devotions, as
they were well aware that God is omnipresent; and in churches
man’s mind is diverted very much by earthly things, The building of
churches often leads to the contrary of what has been intended. It
swallows the property of the Church and produces manifolcl errors,
on account of the many human inventions and innovations connected
with it. Why, I ask, should the Church care for the form of friars',
churches why for the form of their cloister, why for the appearance

> of refectories and sleeping rooms with many other things, which have

been smuggled in after the manner of the pharisees; since we know,
that not these outward signs but the pure mind of the man who
meditates on Christ's sufferings, and the soul raised to God in humble

ζ reverence, make the place a holy one? What have we to do with
