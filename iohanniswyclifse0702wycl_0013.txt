lf two prelateS, one superior, the other inferior, order, the lirst
must be obeyed, in reasonable things. Now Christ is superior to any
prelate, and can order nothing but what is reasonable. Consequently,
one must resist everything which a pope or prelate orders contra»)-

on the fact of their being given to lying. ln numerous but scattered
