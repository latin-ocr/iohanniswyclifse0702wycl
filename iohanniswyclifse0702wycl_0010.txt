And as the Pope is here in evident contradiction to Holy
Scripture, many call him Antichrist, as Christ has said: Many will
come in my name and say: l an] Christ etc.

In the name of Christ come these pseudo-popes who are opposed
to Christ in doctrine and life.

The law of Antichrist is praised, that of the Saviour despised,
and the persecutions proceeding from this Antichrist surpass those
