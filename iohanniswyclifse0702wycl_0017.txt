own order (those, namely, who desire to free themselves from the¹
rule); secondly because they ruin many people by their lies, slandcsing
as heretics the faithful who teach the truth concerning the Eucharist;
of what they themselves are ignorant3 thirdly in persecutiug with
pernicious hatred simple priests. 'l'herefore it is time for the sccular
lords to put an end to them, and so Grosseteste is right in scourging
the monstrosities of these friars, who pretend their inventions to bc
dogmas of the Church. Their lips are stained by lying, and their
hands by human blood, and so they are indeed sons of Caim (Cain),
as even the name of Caim (Cain) indicates, in which C stands for
the carmelites, A the Augustines, Ι the Jacobites (Dominicans) and
M the Minor friars. From this Cain's tribe, may the Lord deliver us.¹

As concerns the begging of the friars, the argument is a diabolical
one, which the pope ought to be ashamed to use, that because Paul
in one instance collected earthly goods for the Saints in Jerusalem,
these “sturdy'’ friars may habitually beg for themselves, or: lf the
faithful minister necessaries of life to their pieachers, the peoplc may
bestow large property on the mendicant friars; or finally: If the
apostle ate amongst the heathen what was convenient to him, so also
these friars may institute observances of their own in eating and
drinking. But from the Gospel we learn that the “poor” blind, the
“poor'' lame, and the “poor'' weak‚ ‚were supported by the Apostle. It
was neither for himself nor for the rich that he begged.

He chose rather to earn his bread by the work of his hands3 and
so these able-bodied beggars should live on the work of their hands,
and not be burdensome to their countries which they considerably weaken,
as they do England, by depriving it of hands and of much money.2

The sriars are not allowed to tell the truth, as many of the
more educated amongst them confess. lt is often said: “A monk
out of cloister is like a writhing fish out of water.'’ ssut how is it,
that so many of thern live out of the cloister, and meddle with
worldly affairs, but in ecclesiastical matters they are either silent like
idiots, or disseminate new heresies. Like the minstrels or buffoons
they make their way into houses, and eat up the property of the
poor, without doing them any reciprocat service, as even the minstrels do.
