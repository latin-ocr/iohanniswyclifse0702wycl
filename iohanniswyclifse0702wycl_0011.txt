according to the Holy Scripture.¹ But no obedience is shown to
Christ by defending the worldly possession or the disorder of the
clergy, for both arc contrary to Holy Scripture; and to defend them,
is rather to resist Christ, and to become a servant of Antichrist.

As regards earthly laws, those clergymen are to blame who
meddle exclusively with human statutes, those of the Popes and
Emperors, and neglect those of God.

Christ did not write his laws on rables, or on skins of dead
animals, but in the hearts of men.2

In other passages Wyclif is even more severe on the Pope, the
Pope's election and the power of the keys.

The Church of the faithful is bound to expel the errors of Anti-
christ, and to believe steadfastly in the Holy Scripture. Now three
errors have been smuggled into the Church by the folly of Antichrist,
and the faithful should scorn them all.

The first is: Because St. Peter died at Rome, and Constantine
was Emperor there, every Roman Bishop —r as if he were of necessity
the most able — is to be set above all Christendom. By the same
reasoning Mohamedans might conclude, that their “melate'’ at Jerusalem,
where Christ the teacher of Peter died, is greater than the Pope, more
especially as he was installed by a mightier ruler than Constantine.

From the place of his see, therefore, the right of the Roman
Bishop to supremacy cannot be concluded, while if righteousness of
life grants this right, how can the Roman Bishop be put over all
other bishops, as it can be proved from his life, that in word and
deed he is an adversary of Christ. 3

A similarly fallacious conclusion is the second: If the emperor,
or any other worldly prince, must be elected by certain electors, in
