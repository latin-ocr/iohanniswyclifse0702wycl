the whole Church. The devil argues thus: More than for God’s cause
the clergy fight for their property. They airn at acquiring and at
keeping for ever the acquisition.

This they like better than preaching the Gospel, though that
is the most important office of the priest.

Now the Church, and every tribe, and race suffer fron] the great
fault of Silvester. In return for their property the clergy accomplish
nothing; they neither defend their native country, nor do they invade
hostile countries; they do not quiet the provinces3 what smacks of
gain, they greedily take, and from anybody vvhatever; what savours of
work, they leave alone. Antichrist fancies that he is not subject to
the secular arm.

That St. Thomas died for the defence of the endowment of the
Church‚ is a diabolical assertion of the clergy, which they are not
able to prove. For none of the 16 Articles for which he died, has
anything to do with the endowment of the prelates, or is against the
deprivation of what has been foolishly given to them.

Ecclesiastical properties belong to the poor¹ and this property
Thomas defended for his poor3 and if the clergy occupied with
worldly matters neglected their parishes, he put fit people in their
places; and finally, he did not allow the poor to be ill-treated by
the rich. Our clergy act contrary to all these points, for they prefer
carthly dirt to heavenly bliss. As morever St. Thomas knew how
worldly property had corrupted the clergy, he would have acted better
still, if he had left the goods in secular hands.

And so too it has been with the other saints. If they received
and accepted endowment‚ it is likely that they repented of it. They
probably considered the money as alms and used it accordingly.
Therefore the saints lived quite differently from our priests,

The clergy should be contented with food and clothing; all
bishops who strive after worldly honours and riches‚ belong to Anti·
christ and are not members of the Holy Church.2

lf worldly dominion savours of sin even in a layman‚ since it
is apt to be attended by pride, envy, avarice &Q3 how much more
in the clergy, who have taken the vow of poverty. With the clergy,
