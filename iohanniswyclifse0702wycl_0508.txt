last refuge, they revile as hereties all who would reform
its abuses.

This evil must be torn up by the root. The secular power
must reform the Church, and take its endowments. The
Clergy must be content with food and elothing. Chureh
property belongs to the poor. Grand ohurches do not incite
to pie1y3 they turn men from it. The Friars, in their
haughtiness, build edifices and towers like the Tower of
Babel; and the Monks, cloisters like eastles. Deprivation‚
povcrty, sharp control, is what they need.

This contest with monachism is the main subject of
WVyclif’s second volume of sermons, though some dogmatio
questions are ineidentally disoust in it3 and in one note-
worthy passage the Preaeher says, that if the Chureh were
deprived of Sacraments and Saeramental usages, it would
not die; for, to the Christian, Christ is Pope‚ bishop, priest,
and can give salvation without superfluous symbols.

The second book for the Society's issue of 1887 will be
the eighth of Wyclif's Samum Tlaeeoloqz'ae, the Treatise De
Offi‘ez'o Reqis; a strange eontrast to the plain outspokenness
and forthrightness of the exposure and denunciation of the
Begging Friars in the Sermons. It is a very involved and
difficult discussion of the Royal Power3 and the difficulty
was increased last year by the less good of the two MSS. of
the work having been first copied (by Dr. Buddensieg's
assistant) for the Society. Full collation with the better
MS. in Vienna was, after a time, found to be indispensable
for the understandin g of the Treatise, and the productiori of
a decent text. This collation has been only lately finisht
by Dr. Herzberg-Frankeh and the Editors‚ Mr. A. W.
Pollard and Mr. O. Sayle, hope to send the De Officio Regyz's
soon to press, and to get it into Members' hands this year.

2. For 1888, Prof. Loserth has in type part of the third
volume of Wyclif's Semnan-9, and hopes he may be able-—
with Messrs. Fromme’s and Mr. Matthew's help—to finish it
before Christmas; nay, by that time, to have Vol. 4 of the
Sermone at press for 1889. Dr. Reginald L. Poole hopes
to get into type by the end of 1888 the text of Wyclif’s
De Dominio Divino, and go to Vienna to collate it with the
MSS. some time this year. He has workt through the
treatise De Pauper-ie δαῖϊαίονίε of Richard F itz-Ralph, Arch-
bishop of Armagh‚ of which the first four books will form
the Appendix to his volume. This work has never yet been
printed, but as Dr. Poole has found that it throws great
